<h2> One Piece Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>
    The feedback my sister gave me was the column paragraph she said it was unique and it shows you how long you come from having know experience in this topic to having enough to show others she thinks it shows growth even it not the best it shows trial and error. This whole semester was amazing I enjoyed the teaching and reviewing
    in classes it showed growth in my ability in this class from html, css and lil bit of javascript. I thank you for that Professor Wallace. This project I was kind of skeptical espically The Space X until you said you can do your own I decided to do my favorite anime One Piece and you accepted it gave me much more respect for you. What I will do I would different is the colors I wouldve done it differently other than that 
    its perfectly fine.
