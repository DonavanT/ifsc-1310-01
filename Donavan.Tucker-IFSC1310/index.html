<h2> One Piece Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>
  The column paragraph was the subject of comments from my sister, who thought it was original and demonstrated how long it takes to get enough expertise in a subject to be able to share it with others. She believes that even though it isn't perfect, it demonstrates growth via trial and error. The lectures and class review during the entire semester were enjoyable, and it was clear that my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and a little bit of javascript had improved. I appreciate it, Professor Wallace. When you said you could do your own version of this project, especially The Space X, I decided to do my favorite anime One Piece. You accepted it, which greatly increased my respect for you.

The shell, or alternatively the design and appearance, is the greatest portion. Because of the numerous options for interaction it provides as well as its ability to alter and interact with the display and content layers, JavaScript is the component that can actually pull a website together to create a "experience."
I'm not entirely sure how to assemble an M&M with the hard candy shell on.Progressive Enhancements, a graphic organizer for creating websites, is my recommendation for how you should manage a website. It appears to be useful for other things as well, but for websites, it displays you as an example M&M.
